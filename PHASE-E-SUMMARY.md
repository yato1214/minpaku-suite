## ðŸš€ Usage Instructions

### Running Integration Tests

#### With PHPUnit (Recommended)
```bash
# Install PHPUnit
composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit

# Run all tests
vendor/bin/phpunit --configuration phpunit.xml

# Run specific test class
vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Integration/RateResolverTest.php

# Generate coverage report
vendor/bin/phpunit --configuration phpunit.xml --coverage-html tests/coverage
```

#### Validation Without PHPUnit
```bash
# Check syntax and structure
php validate-tests.php
```

### Demo Environment Setup

#### Seed Demo Data
```bash
# Seed complete demo environment
wp minpaku seed-demo

# Force seed without confirmation
wp minpaku seed-demo --force

# Clean up existing demo data first
wp minpaku seed-demo --cleanup-first --force
```

#### Clean Up Demo Data
```bash
# Remove all demo data
wp minpaku cleanup-demo --force
```

#### Demo Login Credentials
- **Usernames**: `karuizawa_owner`, `tokyo_owner`, `kyoto_owner`
- **Password**: `demo_password_123`
