# M4.1 External WP Connector - Pull Request Documentation

## Summary

This PR completes the M4.1 External WP Connector finishing task with comprehensive enhancements to both the external WordPress connector plugin and the portal-side API. This implementation provides a production-ready connector system with proper distribution, enhanced UX, robust error handling, security improvements, and complete internationalization.

## Key Deliverables Completed

### A) External WP Connector Enhancements

1. **Zip Distribution System**
   - Created PowerShell build script (`connectors/build-zip.ps1`) for automated distribution packaging
   - Generates distribution-ready zip with proper file structure and documentation
   - Includes automated CSS asset generation and readme creation

2. **Connection Test UX Improvements**
   - Enhanced AJAX-based connection testing with detailed error categorization
   - User-friendly error messages with specific guidance for different failure scenarios
   - Real-time feedback with loading states and actionable troubleshooting steps

3. **Shortcode Safety & User Experience**
   - Comprehensive error handling for all shortcode failure scenarios
   - Semantic HTML structure with proper ARIA attributes
   - User-friendly error messages with admin guidance links
   - Graceful degradation when API is unavailable

4. **Logging & Diagnostics**
   - Comprehensive WP_DEBUG_LOG integration throughout the connector
   - Structured error logging for debugging external site issues
   - Performance monitoring for API calls and caching

5. **Internationalization Updates**
   - Added 40+ new Japanese translation strings for enhanced UX
   - Complete i18n coverage for all M4.1 error messages and user guidance
   - Compiled MO files for immediate deployment

### B) Portal-Side Improvements

1. **CORS & Preflight Handling**
   - Proper OPTIONS request handling for external WordPress sites
   - Origin validation against configured allowed domains
   - Secure CORS headers with credential handling

2. **Lightweight Rate Limiting**
   - Transient-based rate limiting with per-endpoint limits
   - Configurable limits: verify (10/min), properties (30/min), availability (60/min), quotes (20/min)
   - Graceful error responses with retry guidance

3. **Portal i18n Updates**
   - Added new Japanese translations for CORS and rate limiting messages
   - Updated MO files for immediate deployment

## Technical Implementation Details

### Security Enhancements
- HMAC-SHA256 signature verification with nonce replay protection
- Origin-based CORS validation
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Proper input sanitization and validation

### Error Handling Strategy
- Categorized error responses (401, 403, 404, 408, 5xx)
- User-friendly error messages with specific guidance
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

### Performance Optimizations
- Transient-based caching for API responses
- Optimized cache durations based on data volatility
- Efficient rate limiting using WordPress transients

## Setup Instructions for Testing

### Prerequisites
- WordPress 5.0+ with admin access
- Portal installation with M4 connector features
- External WordPress site for connector testing

### Portal Setup
1. Navigate to **Minpaku Suite â†’ Connector Settings**
2. Enable the connector and configure allowed domains
3. Generate API keys for external sites
4. Note the API key, secret, and site ID for connector configuration

### External Connector Setup
1. Extract the connector plugin from the distribution zip
2. Install and activate on the external WordPress site
3. Configure connection settings with portal URL and API credentials
4. Test the connection using the enhanced connection test feature

### Testing Connection Test UX
1. Test with correct credentials (should show success with version info)
2. Test with wrong URL (should show specific URL error guidance)
3. Test with wrong credentials (should show authentication guidance)
4. Test with blocked domain (should show domain allowlist guidance)

### Testing Shortcode Safety
1. Use shortcodes with various configurations:
   ```
   [minpaku_properties]
   [minpaku_calendar property_id="123"]
   [minpaku_embed property_id="456"]
   ```
2. Test with misconfigured API (should show user-friendly errors)
3. Test with network issues (should gracefully degrade)
4. Verify error messages are helpful and actionable

### Testing Rate Limiting
1. Make rapid API calls to test rate limiting
2. Verify proper error responses with retry guidance
3. Test different endpoints have different limits

## Acceptance Criteria

### Distribution & Setup
